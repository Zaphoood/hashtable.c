# Hash table

This is a simple hash table implemented in C using no external libraries.

It is by no means meant to be used in an actual application; instead, my goal was to experiment and get an understanding of how hash tables work under the hood.

## Compiling

To compile, run `./build.sh`, which will generate an executable `hashtable`.
